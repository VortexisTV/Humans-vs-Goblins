# Humans-vs-Goblins
The "Humans VS Goblins" game is an engaging turn-based strategy game where players control characters represented as humans. This Java project aims to implement a grid-based game world using UTF characters to visually represent players and goblins. Combat is initiated when a human and goblin collide.
